### Hi there, Iâ€™m Luiza ðŸŒ™

ðŸŒŒ **About me**  
Iâ€™m an **architect**, **illustrator**, and **teacher** â€” now embracing the journey into **frontend development**.  
With a creative background and a curious mind, Iâ€™m passionate about building beautiful, functional, and meaningful digital experiences.

With a background in architecture and digital illustration, I bring a creative eye to every project I touch.  
As a teacher, I know how to explain, share, and connect â€” and I apply that same energy when Iâ€™m learning something new.
âœ¨ Iâ€™m dedicated, curious, and always ready to improve. I believe that with effort and persistence, anything can be learned.
