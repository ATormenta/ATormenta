I’m an architect, illustrator, and teacher, currently diving deep into the world of **frontend development**.  
I’m passionate about learning and I’m always eager to challenge myself with new tools, languages, and projects.

🖼 With a background in architecture and digital illustration, I bring a creative eye to every project I touch.  
👩‍🏫 As a teacher, I know how to explain, share, and connect — and I apply that same energy when I’m learning something new.  
💻 Right now, I’m focusing on **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React** and building solid frontend foundations.

✨ I’m dedicated, curious, and always ready to improve. I believe that with effort and persistence, anything can be learned.

Let’s connect and build something amazing!
